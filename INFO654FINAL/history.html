      <h2>The History of Squirrels in NYC</h2>
      <img src="images/Squirrel_looking_at_camera.jpg" alt="A squirrel in Central Park">
      <p>Squirrels have had a complicated relationship with the inhabitants of New York City—one year our furriest friends, the next unwanted pests. They don’t easily survive in urban environments, needing forested areas to burrow and store food, but New York’s ample parks provide excellent homes for squirrels. The widespread development of the city’s infrastructure all but eliminated the local squirrel population, and <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/wildlifenyc/animals/eastern-gray-squirrels.page">"by the mid-1800s, spotting a squirrel in New York City was such a rare occurrence that crowds would sometimes form if one was seen on a city street.”</a></p>
      <p>Squirrels ping-ponged between being hunted and conserved in the latter part of the 1800s. <a href="https://nymag.com/news/features/squirrels-2014-2/">A New York Magazine article</a> covered this history—in 1877, squirrels were reintroduced to Central Park, leading to a population boom. Squirrel hunts commenced in the ensuing decades to keep the population in check, but some sentimental naturalists help our comrades-in-squeak by feeding them. Squirrels become indicative of the socioeconomic and xenophobic prejudices of the era, as “workers at Central Park and the Bronx Zoo accuse Italian laborers of hunting squirrels for food, and a guard in a Bronx park is beaten ­unconscious while ­trying to arrest a ­squirrel poacher.” Theodore Roosevelt accuses squirrel-aligned humans of “idealizing wild animals for their own purposes.”</p>
      <p>Squirrels lose their place in the spotlight in the years to come, but will still appear in the headlines now and then for their various hijinks among the humans and infrastructure of New York. In 1987, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/squirrels-trading-new-york-stock-exchange/398108/">a squirrel in Trumbull, Connecticut chewed through a wire</a>, causing a power outage that shut down the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, a.k.a. NASDAQ, which halted trading for thousands of bankers in New York. Our intrepid squirrel, sadly, passed away.</p>
